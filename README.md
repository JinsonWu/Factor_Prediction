# Factor_Prediction
Predict advanced semiconductor fabrication (Gate All-Around Breakdown) factors by reinforcement learning.
In case that the dataset is from unpublished papers, the training data we used can't be revealed. 
We utilize cut-off manager to determine when to pause the breakdown operation. 
As result, we obtain 40% of accuracy in this dataset.
If the model is trained with more dataset, it is convincing that the performace can be significantly improved.
